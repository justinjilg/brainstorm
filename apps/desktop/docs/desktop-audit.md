# Brainstorm Desktop — Honest Audit

**Date:** 2026-04-16
**State:** Phase 0 baseline. No code changed yet.
**Method:** Three parallel static audits (IPC + hooks, per-view wiring, visual craft) + `tsc --noEmit` + build-artifact check. No Playwright drive yet (coming in Phase 0.5).

## TL;DR

The **backend plumbing is real work**: proper Electron security (`contextIsolation`, strict CSP, `will-navigate` block, `setWindowOpenHandler: deny`), IPC method allowlist, Zod param validation on every method, structured `{type:"ready"}` readiness signal, pid+uuid tempfile for timers cleared on backend exit, auto-respawn with bounded retries, scrubbed config responses. Multiple commits this session landed against it.

The **renderer integration is the weak link.** The README claims all 10 views "Working" — that's aspirational, not factual. Several flagship flows (abort, trace, plan, multi-conversation, model-switching from the Models view) silently do nothing or surface fake data. The visual shell is disciplined but incomplete: the Geist font system is _disabled_ (a leftover from the Tauri era), the favicon is broken, zero custom SVGs exist anywhere, and every empty state is a text block.

Net quality estimate: **4.5–5.0 / 10.** The ceiling is high because the design system, security posture, and backend protocol are already good — but there are at least three flows where a user clicks something prominent and nothing happens.

## Headline findings (start here)

### H1. `chat.abort` is not in the IPC allowlist → the Abort button does nothing in packaged Electron

- `apps/desktop/src/lib/ipc-client.ts:73` calls `request("chat.abort")`.
- `apps/desktop/electron/main.ts:199-222` `ALLOWED_METHODS` does **not** include `"chat.abort"`.
- The allowlist rejection throws; the `catch {}` around the call swallows it silently.
- Net effect: user clicks Stop mid-stream, local AbortController flips UI state, but the backend keeps generating (and billing) until natural completion or the 5-min main-process timeout fires.
- Also: `ipcMain.handle("chat-abort", ...)` at `main.ts:291` is registered but unreachable because preload exposes no bridge for it. Dead code.

### H2. `conversationId` is stripped by the Zod schema → every chat turn starts a fresh session

- Renderer passes `conversationId` in `streamChat` params (`ipc-client.ts:40-60`).
- `ChatStreamParams` Zod schema (`packages/cli/src/ipc/handler.ts:69-75`) declares only `sessionId`. Zod's default `.strip()` drops unknown keys.
- Handler falls back to `session-${Date.now()}` — every message opens a new session, even when the sidebar still shows "this conversation."
- Compound bug: `useConversations.create` also ignores the current project (see H3), so the session isn't even filed against the right project.

### H3. `currentProject` never reaches `conversations.create`

- `useConversations.ts:24-37` — `create(name, modelOverride)` has no projectPath param.
- Backend defaults to the CLI's cwd (where `brainstorm ipc` was spawned, i.e. the shell pwd when the app launched).
- Subsequent `conversations.list({ project: currentProject })` can't find the created conversation. The user picks a folder, makes a conversation, and it vanishes.

### H4. `ChatView.onAgentEvent` is explicitly discarded → the TraceView is always empty

- `ChatView.tsx:37` literally does `void _onAgentEvent`.
- `App.tsx` is engineered to route chat events through that prop into `setTraceEvents(...)`, but no events reach it.
- The whole Trace mode (`⌘7`) looks polished and renders a real filter/inspector/rail — and is permanently empty in production.
- Approve/Deny buttons on trace rows fire handlers that are empty functions.

### H5. `ModelsView` "Use This Model" and `CommandPalette` model switch don't actually change routing

- `App.tsx` `onModelSelect` sets `activeModel` (name) + `activeProvider`, but **not** `activeModelId`.
- `ChatView` sends `{ modelId: activeModelId }` to the router.
- The StatusRail shows "now using Claude Opus 4.6" — the router keeps using whatever the default was.
- Same story for `CommandPalette.onModelSwitch`. Only the title-bar `ModelSwitcher` correctly sets `activeModelId`, and it uses a hardcoded `MODELS` constant (not `useModels()` from the backend).

### H6. Entire Plan view is a fake pipeline

- Executes via `workflow.run` correctly, but the phase/task/approval UI is driven by a client-side synthetic plan:
  ```ts
  const newPlan: Plan = { ... phases: [{ id:"exec", tasks: [], cost: 0 }], totalCost: 0, budget: 0 }
  ```
- `PlanView.tsx` comment: `// Plan control handlers — will be wired to workflow engine`.
- `onPause`/`onResume` only mutate local state — no `workflow.pause`/`workflow.resume` IPC.
- `onApprove` is empty (`// Phase approval — will trigger next phase via workflow engine`).
- Pipeline progress is `completedPhases / 1 = 100%` after a single await completes.
- This is the worst fake-real offender in the app.

### H7. Geist fonts are not actually loading

- `package.json` declares `@fontsource/geist` and `@fontsource-variable/geist-mono`.
- `index.css:2-3` explicitly comments out the imports — a Tauri-era workaround that was never reinstated after the Electron migration: _"Geist font loaded via system fallback — @fontsource imports removed to prevent CSS resolution failures in Tauri webview"_.
- The app is on Electron now. The comment is stale.
- Users see `-apple-system` / system-ui, **not** Geist Sans or Geist Mono.
- The design system's entire typographic claim ("Bloomberg × Linear × Raycast" per `index.css:7`) is hollow until this is reverted.

### H8. Broken favicon + no splash screen + no backendReady gate

- `index.html:5` references `/brainstorm.svg` — the file does not exist in `public/`.
- `main.tsx:6-10` mounts React immediately with no pre-paint.
- `App.tsx` has no "backend booting" state distinct from "backend disconnected." During the first 1-2s of boot, views mount and fire IPC calls that time out.
- FOUC on cold boot: the body paints native background briefly before Vite-hydrated Tailwind arrives.

### Visual craft gaps

#### Icons & illustrations

- Zero SVGs anywhere in the app. `public/` is empty. No lucide-react. No icon library.
- Broken favicon — `index.html:5` references a non-existent file.
- Every empty state is a text block (`ChatView`, `TraceView`, `Navigator`, `SkillsView`, `InspectorPanel`, `ModelsView`).
- No view header has visual identity — every mode starts with the same uppercase-eyebrow + text-title pattern.

#### Micro-interactions

**Working:** streaming cursor (`▎`), tool-call pending→running→complete transition, context gauge width transition, message stagger-fade-in, inspector slide-in-right.

**Missing:**

- Cost ticker jumps instantly (`StatusRail.tsx:112-119`) — no rolling-digit animation.
- Trace events don't animate on enter — just append (`TraceView.tsx:143-156`).
- Mode switching is instant — no crossfade.
- Thinking indicator is a pulsing dot + static text.

#### Typography

- **Fonts disabled (see H7).** Without Geist, the design system's claim is unreached.
- No real heading hierarchy; `<h1>` / `<h2>` / `<h3>` appear only in `Markdown.tsx`. Everywhere else it's a `span` with `--text-2xs` or `--text-lg`.
- `ModelsView` mixes Tailwind arbitrary sizes (`text-[10px]`) with inline `style={{ fontSize: "var(--text-2xs)" }}` — visible inconsistency.

#### First-paint / boot

- No backendReady gate (see R4).
- No splash screen.
- No pre-React paint.
- FOUC on cold boot (native body styles flash before Tailwind).

#### Keyboard feel

- `CommandPalette` uses substring (`.includes()`) not fuzzy search.
- Palette is static; doesn't contribute actions from loaded skills, conversations, models.
- Tooltips are native `title=""` — 600ms OS delay, unstyled.
- Esc is inconsistent — KeyboardOverlay has no explicit Esc handler, mode-switch has no Esc-back-to-chat.
- KeyboardOverlay documents 6+ shortcuts that aren't wired anywhere (see F8).

#### Color & character

- Catppuccin Mocha applied consistently. Provider/role taxonomies defined once and reused. Good.
- One off-palette color: `--color-google: #4285f4` clashes with `--ctp-blue: #89b4fa`.
- Dark-mode only (probably fine — but commit to it in the system).
- **No signature visual moment.** Nothing makes the app recognizable at a glance. Linear is recognizable zoomed-out; Brainstorm isn't yet.

#### Missing entirely

- No onboarding / first-run flow.
- No toast notifications. Errors either banner-at-top or inline-silent.
- No skeleton loaders. Loading states are text + `animate-pulse-glow`.
- No contextual tooltips beyond `title=""`.

### Clean (worth preserving)

- Electron security posture: `contextIsolation:true`, `nodeIntegration:false`, tight CSP, `will-navigate:deny`, `setWindowOpenHandler:deny`.
- IPC method allowlist pattern (the bug isn't the pattern, it's the missing entry).
- Zod validation across every user-input method with clean error formatting.
- Structured `{type:"ready"}` protocol replaces the old stderr-substring match.
- `pendingTimers` cleared on backend exit.
- Scrubbed config responses.
- Unicode-glyph icon system (●, ◐, ○, ✓, ✗, ◆, ▎, ⌘, ⚠, ▸, ⏸) consistently used — a real aesthetic choice.
- Catppuccin Mocha palette + provider/role color taxonomies.
- Streaming cursor (`▎` with `animate-cursor-blink`).
- Tool-call state transition (glow-mauve background, pulse-glow dot, spinner → ✓/✗).
- Context gauge smooth width + color transition.
- Inspector slide-in-right.
- Editorial assistant-message treatment (`ChatView.tsx:431-462`) — best craft moment in the app.
- Design tokens (duration scale, easing curves, type scale) in `index.css:10-85`.

## Priority order for Phase 1 — Functional Completeness

Fix in this order. Each gets its own commit. Each ships a Playwright spec that fails without the fix and passes with it.

**Wave A — Critical silent failures (week 1)**

1. **H1 — `chat.abort` allowlist** — add to `ALLOWED_METHODS`; wire an explicit abort event; remove dead `chat-abort` handler OR expose it via preload. Verify the backend actually stops billing.
2. **H2 — `conversationId` Zod schema** — accept `conversationId` in `ChatStreamParams` and load prior session history before the turn. This is the foundation for a multi-conversation product.
3. **H3 — `currentProject` flows into `conversations.create`** — thread projectPath through the hook and list refresh.
4. **H5 — Model switch actually changes routing** — `activeModelId` gets set by every model-selection entry point (`ModelsView`, `CommandPalette`, `ModelSwitcher`). ModelSwitcher stops using hardcoded `MODELS`, uses `useModels()`.
5. **H4 — Trace event plumbing** — forward `onAgentEvent` from `ChatView` to `App.setTraceEvents`. Wire `TraceView` Approve/Deny to real IPC or remove them. Add a per-row enter animation.

**Wave B — Fake-real replacement (week 2)**

6. **F1 — Plan view** — either wire the workflow engine's event stream back into phase/task state OR replace the UI with a single "execution log" matching what the backend actually exposes. The current elaborate UI is worse than a simple log.
7. **F2 / F5 — Security & Config middleware panels** — introspect real middleware status or delete the panels until there's a real signal to surface.
8. **F3 / F4 — Dashboard Routing & Cost tabs** — real aggregation from `cost_records` table; a real routing-decision stream from the agent loop.
9. **F10 / F11 / F12 — CommandPalette + ModelSwitcher + RolePicker** — fuzzy search (fuse.js or hand-rolled); dynamic commands from live data; RolePicker skills array drives actual `activeSkills`.
10. **F8 — KeyboardOverlay** — either wire the documented shortcuts or remove the entries. Currently it's marketing, not documentation.
11. **S10 — Abort finalization** — partial messages on abort are marked as aborted, not silently appended.

**Wave C — Reconciliation + hook hygiene (week 2-3)**

12. **R1 — Backend-respawn refresh** — every hook that loads-once-on-mount subscribes to a `backend-ready` signal and refetches. Emit the signal as a chat-event so the renderer can react.
13. **R4 — Distinct booting state** — add `backendReady` to the preload bridge; App.tsx renders a splash while false.
14. **R5 — Rehydrate messages on conversation switch** — load prior messages via `conversations.messages`.
15. **S7 / S8 / S9 — Error surfacing** — every hook's mutation path returns or exposes `error`; UI renders it.

---

## Priority order for Phase 2 — Visual Craft

**Top 5 wins (do these before anything else in Phase 2):**

1. **Load Geist fonts.** 5-minute fix — re-enable the `@fontsource` imports in `index.css`. Without this, every design-system claim is hollow.
2. **Ship `brainstorm.svg` + a real cold-boot splash.** Custom SVG mark. Inline `<style>` in `index.html` paints crust background + centered logo before React mounts. Gate `App.tsx` on `serverHealth.checking` with a splash.
3. **Five bespoke empty-state illustrations.** Empty chat (node graph forming), empty trace (quiet waveform), empty memory (archive), empty models (prism), empty workflows (scroll). Inline SVG, ~80-150 lines each, one subtle animation per.
4. **Rolling cost ticker + trace event enter animation.** Per-digit rolling counter on `StatusRail`. 300ms mauve-tint flash + slide-in on each new trace row.
5. **Real fuzzy palette + dynamic commands.** Replace `.includes()` with a scorer. Inject loaded skills, conversations, discovered models.

**Second pass (craft details):**

- Mode-switch crossfade (200ms opacity).
- Tooltip component (presence animation, delay group, mauve tint) replacing `title=""` everywhere.
- Skeleton loaders replacing "Loading X..." text.
- Toast notifications for non-fatal errors (hook errors that currently banner or disappear).
- Button hover/active/disabled states — designed, not defaulted.
- Real heading hierarchy where views have genuine titles.
- One signature visual moment — a custom chart, a provider topology, an agent-force-graph. Something only Brainstorm does.
- Onboarding / first-run flow.

---

## Priority order for Phase 3 — Production Readiness

- DMG launches on a fresh Mac and finds `brainstorm` CLI via PATH or prompts for install.
- `electron-updater` wired; the publish path in `package.json` already points at the GitHub release target.
- DevTools gated behind keyboard shortcut in production, not auto-open.
- CSP stays strict. Zero npm audit findings.
- Code signing (requires Developer ID cert).
- Notarization (requires Apple API key).

---

## Evidence & verification

- **Typecheck:** clean (`tsc --noEmit`, 2026-04-16).
- **Build artifacts present:** `dist/` and `electron/dist/` both populated.
- **Playwright suite:** not yet run for this audit (pending Phase 0.5). Current README claim: 79 tests. Assume mocked until proven otherwise.
- **Manual walkthrough:** not yet. Required in Phase 0.5 — drive each of the 10 views against a live backend, capture screenshots or a screen recording.

## What Phase 0 still needs

Before any code fixes land:

1. Run the full Playwright suite — identify which tests hit a real backend vs mocked state. Mocked tests don't prove flows work; they prove the renderer renders.
2. Start `npm run dev:electron` and drive each of the 10 views by hand. Record findings in this doc (append a "Live verification" section with screenshots).
3. Try the packaged DMG on a fresh user account (or simulate by temporarily moving the brainstorm CLI out of PATH).
4. Confirm each H-finding above reproduces in the live app.

Only after those four are checked off does this audit graduate from "static analysis" to "ground truth."

---

## Open questions for the user

A few decisions that shape the phasing:

1. **Plan view — rewire or replace?** The backend's workflow engine doesn't currently stream step-by-step progress. Do we invest in adding that (lets the fancy pipeline UI become real) or collapse the view to a log (ships sooner)?
2. **Middleware panel (Security / Config) — real introspection or remove?** There's no `middleware.status` IPC today. Adding it means a new method + UI pipe. Removing means the Security page gets thinner.
3. **Onboarding scope.** A full Linear-style onboarding flow is multi-hour work. Minimum viable: a splash with "no models configured — set your first API key" CTA.

None of these block Phase 1 — but answering them early prevents Wave B churn.
